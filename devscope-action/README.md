## � Why Devscope in CI?

**Shift-left code quality** — catch maintainability issues before they reach production.

- ✅ **Instant feedback** — developers see health metrics within seconds on PRs
- ✅ **Preventative maintenance** — block merges when quality drops below thresholds
- ✅ **No configuration required** — works out of the box with sensible defaults
- ✅ **Language agnostic** — analyzes Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Rust, Java, and more
- ✅ **Fast & cached** — pipx dependencies cached between runs (~5-8s after first run)
- ✅ **Non-intrusive** — sticky PR comments (updates in place, no spam)

**Use cases:**
- Enforce maintainability standards across teams
- Monitor tech debt trends in CI
- Gate releases on code health thresholds
- Onboard new contributors with clear quality metrics

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Basic PR Health Check

Add this to `.github/workflows/devscope.yml`:

```yaml
name: Code Health

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  health-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0  # Full history for git metrics
      
      - uses: EhsanAzish80/devscope-action@v1
```

**That's it!** 🎉

## 📖 Usage Examples

### With CI Quality Gate

Fail the workflow if maintainability drops below B:

```yaml
- uses: EhsanAzish80/devscope-action@v1
  with:
    fail-under: B
    max-risk: Medium
    max-onboarding: Moderate
```

**Exit codes:**
- `0` = All thresholds passed
- `1` = Runtime error
- `2` = Threshold violated (fails CI)

### Analyze Specific Directory

```yaml
- uses: EhsanAzish80/devscope-action@v1
  with:
    path: ./src
```

### Use Outputs in Other Steps

```yaml
- uses: EhsanAzish80/devscope-action@v1
  id: devscope

- name: Check grade
  run: |
    echo "Grade: ${{ steps.devscope.outputs.grade }}"
    echo "Risk: ${{ steps.devscope.outputs.risk }}"
    
    if [ "${{ steps.devscope.outputs.grade }}" == "F" ]; then
      echo "::warning::Code health is critical!"
    fi
```

### Custom GitHub Token

For private repos or fine-grained permissions:

```yaml
- uses: EhsanAzish80/devscope-action@v1
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.CUSTOM_PAT }}
```

## 📊 Example Workflows

### Full CI/CD Pipeline

```yaml
name: Code Quality

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]

jobs:
  health-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
    
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0  # Required for git metrics
      
      - name: Run Devscope
        uses: EhsanAzish80/devscope-action@v1
        id: devscope
        with:
          fail-under: B
          max-risk: Medium
      
      - name: Upload metrics
        if: always()
        run: |
          echo "Health: ${{ steps.devscope.outputs.health }}"
          echo "Grade: ${{ steps.devscope.outputs.grade }}"
          echo "Risk: ${{ steps.devscope.outputs.risk }}"
```

### Monorepo (Multiple Directories)

```yaml
jobs:
  health-check:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        service: [frontend, backend, shared]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      
      - uses: EhsanAzish80/devscope-action@v1
        with:
          path: ./services/${{ matrix.service }}
          fail-under: C
```

### Different Thresholds by Branch

```yaml
- uses: EhsanAzish80/devscope-action@v1
  with:
    fail-under: ${{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && 'A' || 'B' }}
    max-risk: ${{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && 'Low' || 'Medium' }}
```

## ⚡ Performance

This action uses **aggressive caching** for fast runs:

| Phase | First Run | Cached Runs |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Setup Python | ~5s | ~2s (cached) |
| Install devscope | ~10-15s | ~3-5s (pipx cache) |
| Analysis | ~0.5-2s | ~0.5-2s |
| **Total** | **~15-20s** | **~5-8s** ⚡ |

**Optimization tips:**
- Use `fetch-depth: 0` for accurate git metrics
- Enable pipx caching (automatic in this action)
- Run on push + PR for best cache hits

Most runs complete in **under 10 seconds** after initial setup ⚡

## 🔒 Permissions

### Required Permissions

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read          # Read repository code
  pull-requests: write    # Post PR comments
```

**Minimal setup:**
```yaml
jobs:
  health-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: EhsanAzish80/devscope-action@v1
```

### For Forks

If you want to support PRs from forks:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request_target:  # Use with caution!

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
```

⚠️ **Security note:** `pull_request_target` runs with write access. Only use if you trust fork contributors or implement additional checks.

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Comment not appearing on PR

**Check permissions:**
```yaml
permissions:
  pull-requests: write
```

**Verify trigger:**
```yaml
on:
  pull_request:  # Must include this
```

### Action fails with "command not found: devscope"

The action installs devscope automatically. If it fails:

1. Check Python version (requires 3.9+)
2. Clear cache: Go to Actions → Caches → Delete all caches
3. Re-run workflow

### Thresholds not enforced

Thresholds only apply on **push events**, not PRs. PRs show metrics but don't fail.

To enforce on PRs:
```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main]
```

### Slow analysis

Enable caching:
```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    fetch-depth: 0  # Faster git operations
```

---

## 🔄 Versioning

This action follows semantic versioning:

- `@v1` — Latest v1.x.x (recommended, auto-updates)
- `@v1.0.0` — Exact version (pinned, no updates)
- `@main` — Latest commit (unstable, for testing)

**Recommended:**
```yaml
- uses: EhsanAzish80/devscope-action@v1
```

---

## 📦 What's Included

This action:
- Installs [devscope](https://github.com/EhsanAzish80/Devscope) via pipx
- Caches Python dependencies for speed
- Analyzes your codebase (Python, JS, TS, Go, Rust, Java, etc.)
